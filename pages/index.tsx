								British Shorthair cats are an absolute joy to own. These
								affectionate pets are ideal companions for families with
								children and other pets due to their easy going nature, but they
								can adapt to a wide range of environments. The British Shorthair
								breed is much calmer than other cats. You will see your British
								Shorthair play and run for a few minutes, but these cats are
								calm and laidback most of the time. Itâ€™s a cat that will
								surprise you with its intelligence, loyalty, and affection.

							<p className="p-4 leading-relaxed">
								The Scottish Fold is a sweet, charming breed. They are an easy
								cat to live with and to care for. They are affectionate and are
								comfortable with all members of their family. They are attentive
								without being overly demanding. They boast a medium energy level
								compared to other cats and love to play games and interact with
								the family. This kitten-like behavior is retained throughout
								their whole lives which makes these enigmatic cats popular with
								families.

							<h5 className="breed-card-heading">Ragdolls</h5>
							<p className="p-4 leading-relaxed">
								Ragdoll cats are social and happily spend time in the house of
								the owner and rarely wander out on their own. They love being
								with the owner, they yearn for attention and enjoy the company
								of people. They love being embraced by people and often snuggle
								up in their lap. They enjoy following their owners and doing
								what they are doing. Not only do they like people, but they also
								like other cats and other pets, including dogs. In fact, they
								even like strangers!
